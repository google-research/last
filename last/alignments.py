class TimeSyncAlignmentLattice(abc.ABC):
  r"""Interface for time synchronous alignment lattices.

  Frame-dependent and k-constrained label-frame-dependent alignment lattices are
  examples of time synchronous alignment lattices. See Sections 3 and 4 of the
  GNAT paper for more details.

  The alignment lattice is intersected with the context dependency to form the
  topology of a recognition lattice. class last.RecognitionLattice carries out
  this intersection on the fly with the help of methods of
  TimeSyncAlignmentLattice.

  To describe time synchronous alignment lattices, we first introduce the notion
  of a frame-local alignment lattice. A frame-local alignment lattice is an
  acyclic deterministic finite automaton with 2 input labels, "lexical" and
  "blank" with a single final state f.

  Let Q be the set of states in the frame-local alignment and E be the set of
  arcs, a time synchronous alignment lattice is then the same frame-local
  alignment lattice repeated num_frames times,
  -   The states are {(t, a) | 0 <= t < num_frames, a \in Q - {f}} U
      {(num_frames, s)};
  -   The start state is (0, s);
  -   The final state is (T, s);
  -   For any arc (a, y, b), b != f, in E, there is an arc ((t, a), y, (t, b));
  -   For any arc (a, y, f) in E, there is an arc ((t, a), y, (t + 1, s)).
