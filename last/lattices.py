  """Recognition lattice in GNAT-style formulation and operations over it.

  A RecognitionLattice provides operations used in training and inference, such
  as computing the negative-log-probability loss, or finding the highest scoring
  alignment path.

  Following the formulation in GNAT, we combines the three modelling components
  to define a RecognitionLattice:
  -   Context dependency: The finite automaton that models output history. See
      last.contexts.ContextDependency for details.
  -   Alignment lattice: The finite automaton that models the alignment between
      input frames and output labels. See
      last.alignments.TimeSyncAlignmentLattice for details.
  -   Weight function: The neural network that produces arc weights from any
      context state given an input frame. See last.weight_fns for details.

  Given a sequence of `T` input frames, its recognition lattice is the following
  finite automaton:
  -   States: The states are pairs of an alignment state and a context state.
      For any alignment state (t, a) (t is the index of the current frame) and
      context state c, there is a state (t, a, c) in the recognition lattice.
  -   Start state: (0, s_a, s_c), where s_a is the start state in the
      frame-local alignment lattice (see
      last.contexts.TimeSyncAlignmentLattice), and s_c is the start state in the
      context dependency.
  -   Final states: (T, s_a, c) for any context state c.
  -   Arcs:
      -   Blank arcs: For any blank arc `(t, a) -> (t', a')` in the alignment
          lattice, and any context state c, there is an arc
          `(t, a, c) --blank-> (t', a', c)` in the recognition lattice.
      -   Lexical arcs: For any lexical arc `(t, a) -> (t', a')` in the
          alignment lattice, and any arc `c --y-> c'` in the context dependency,
          there is an arc `(t, a, c) --y-> (t', a', c')` in the recognition
          lattice.
  -   Arc weights: For each state (t, a, c), the weight function receives the
      t-th frame and the context state c, and produces arc weights for blank
      and lexical arcs. Notably while in principle weight functions can also
      depend on the alignment state, in practice we haven't yet encountered a
      compelling reason for such weight functions. Thus for the sake of
      simplicity, weight functions currently only depend on the frame and the
      context state.

  The arc weights can be used to model the conditional distribution of the paths
  in the recognition lattice, especially those that lead to the reference label
  sequence. A RecognitionLattice can be either a locally normalized model, or
  a globally normalized model,
  -   A locally normalized model uses last.weight_fns.LocallyNormalizedWeightFn,
      where the arc weights from the same recognition lattice state add up to 1
      after taking an exponential. The probability of
      P(alignment labels | frames) is simply the product of arc weights on the
      alignment path after exponential.
  -   A globally normalized model uses a WeightFn that is not a subclass of
      last.weight_fns.LocallyNormalizedWeightFn. To obtain a probabilistic
      interpretation, we normalize the path weights with the sum of the
      exponentiated weights of all possible paths in the recognition lattice.

  Globally normalized models are more expensive to train, but they have various
  advantages. See the GNAT paper for more details.

    """Computes arc marginals under the log semiring using the backward algorithm.

    Under the log semiring, arc weights can be viewed as unnormalized log
    probabilities, and a conditional distribution over paths can be defined by
    normalizing with respect to the exponentiated shortest distance (i.e. sum of
    unnormalized path probabilities). The marginal probability of each arc can
    then be computed with the backward algorithm.

    Mathematically, under the log semiring, arc marginals are equal to the
    gradients of shortest distance with respect to arc weights. The backward
    algorithm offers a slightly more efficient method for computing these
    gradients than reverse mode automatic differentiation with gradient
    rematerialization:
    -   Both methods compute the arc weights twice: once in the forward pass,
        once in the backward pass.
    -   Both methods carry out the "backward-broadcast" operation, i.e.
        broadcasting the backward weights from a destination state to all source
        states, once in the backward pass.
    -   Autodiff carries out the "forward-reduce" operation, i.e. summing up
        path weights to the same destination state, twice: once in the forward
        pass, once in the backward pass.
    -   Forward-backward only carries out the "forward-reduce" operation once,
        in the forward pass.

    In other words, forward-backward saves one "forward-reduce" operation. The
    savings can be significant when the "forward-reduce" call is often
    expensive, which is the main justification for all this added complexity.

      log_z: [batch_dims...] shortest distance from _forward(). Under the log
